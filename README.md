# User_Ai_Adoption_prediction
This project focuses on building an end-to-end User Adoption Prediction System using Machine Learning and Web Deployment. It leverages a Random Forest model to classify user engagement tiers (High/Medium/Low) by processing messy behavioral data. Key technologies used include Python, Flask, HTML, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.



User Adoption Prediction System
Full-Stack Machine Learning Solution (ML + Flask + Web)
This project focuses on building an end-to-end predictive system to classify user engagement tiers (High, Medium, or Low). By leveraging a Random Forest Classifier and a Flask web interface, this tool transforms "messy" behavioral data into actionable business insights to help product teams reduce churn and improve user retention.

Tech Stack & Tools
Language: Python

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, SMOTE for Imbalance)

Web Framework: Flask

Frontend: HTML5, Bootstrap 5

Model Deployment: Joblib

Key Project Highlights
Messy Data Cleaning: Handled a dataset of 2,000+ rows, managing missing values and inconsistent formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key drivers of adoption, such as login frequency and training attendance.

Advanced ML Pipeline: Implemented feature engineering and balanced the classes to ensure the model predicts "High Adoption" users as accurately as "Low Adoption" ones.

Interactive Web App: Created a user-friendly interface where anyone can input user metrics and receive an instant prediction without writing a single line of code.
